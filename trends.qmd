title: "🕰️ Rising Risk: A Timeline of Humanitarian Harm"

Aid workers have faced growing danger in their efforts to deliver life-saving assistance. But how has this risk evolved over time?

Using event-level data from thousands of attacks, we trace the shifting timeline of threats — and reveal a troubling trend.

## 🚨 The Question

**Has the world become more dangerous for humanitarians?**  
To find out, we plot every known attack from 1997 to the present — each one a story of danger in the line of duty.

## 📊 The Data: Incidents by Year

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Load and prepare data
df <- read_csv("security_incidents.csv")

yearly_counts <- df %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Incidents = n())

# Plot
p <- ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Incidents)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#e63946") +
  labs(
    title = "Aid Worker Attacks, 1997–Present",
    subtitle = "Each bar represents the number of recorded security incidents in a year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Incidents"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p)
```

## 🔍 What the Trend Reveals

The numbers tell a powerful story:

- **1997–2002**: Aid work was dangerous — but relatively infrequent attacks.
- **2003–2005**: Violence surges after the invasion of Iraq and conflict escalation in Afghanistan.
- **2013**: A clear peak — the rise of civil war in Syria and unrest across Sub-Saharan Africa.
- **2018–Present**: A troubling new normal — attacks have stayed persistently high.

We’re not just seeing isolated incidents. We’re seeing **systemic patterns** tied to global unrest.

## 🧭 Data Meets Decision-Making

By identifying **when** threats escalate, aid agencies can:

- **Anticipate** future high-risk years based on conflict cycles
- **Strengthen protocols** in advance
- **Allocate resources** for staff safety training and evacuation planning

This isn’t just analysis — it’s **a call to protect those who protect others.**
