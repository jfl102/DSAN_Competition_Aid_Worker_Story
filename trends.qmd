title: "🕰️ Rising Risk: A Timeline of Humanitarian Harm"
format: html

Aid workers have faced growing danger in their efforts to deliver life-saving assistance. But how has this risk evolved over time?

Using event-level data from thousands of attacks, we trace the shifting timeline of threats — and reveal a troubling trend.

---

## 🚨 The Question

**Has the world become more dangerous for humanitarians?**  
To find out, we plot every known attack from 1997 to the present — each one a story of danger in the line of duty.

---

## 📊 The Data: Incidents by Year

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Load and prepare data
df <- read_csv("security_incidents.csv")

yearly_counts <- df %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Incidents = n())

# Plot
p <- ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(x = Year, y = Incidents)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#e63946") +
  labs(
    title = "Aid Worker Attacks, 1997–Present",
    subtitle = "Each bar represents the number of recorded security incidents in a year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Incidents"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p)
```

## 🔍 What the Trend Reveals

The numbers tell a powerful story:

- **1997–2002**: Aid work was dangerous — but relatively infrequent attacks.
- **2003–2005**: Violence surges after the invasion of Iraq and conflict escalation in Afghanistan.
- **2013**: A clear peak — the rise of civil war in Syria and unrest across Sub-Saharan Africa.
- **2018–Present**: A troubling new normal — attacks have stayed persistently high.

We’re not just seeing isolated incidents. We’re seeing **systemic patterns** tied to global unrest.

## 🔄 How Attack Types Have Changed

Not only are attacks increasing — the way they happen is shifting too. Are shootings still the most common? Are kidnappings rising?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)

# Group by Year and Means of attack
attack_trends <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Means of attack`)) %>%
  group_by(Year, `Means of attack`) %>%
  summarise(Incidents = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  rename(Attack_Type = `Means of attack`)

# Define a custom color palette
attack_colors <- c(
  "Shooting" = "#e63946",
  "Kidnapping" = "#f4a261",
  "Bodily assault" = "#e76f51",
  "Roadside IED" = "#457b9d",
  "Shelling" = "#a8dadc",
  "Complex attack" = "#1d3557",
  "Vehicle-born IED" = "#264653",
  "Landmine" = "#2a9d8f",
  "Other Explosives" = "#8ecae6",
  "Unknown" = "#adb5bd",
  "Aerial bombardment" = "#ffb703",
  "Body-borne IED" = "#fb8500",
  "Rape/sexual assault" = "#6a4c93",
  "Kidnap-killing" = "#b5179e"
)

# Plot
p <- ggplot(attack_trends, aes(x = Year, y = Incidents, fill = Attack_Type)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = attack_colors) +
  labs(
    title = "How Attack Types Have Shifted Over Time",
    y = "Number of Incidents",
    x = "Year",
    fill = "Attack Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)

# Interactive plot
ggplotly(p)
```

This stacked bar chart uncovers a complex evolution of attack strategies. In the early 2000s, **shootings and shelling** dominated the landscape. But over time, we've seen a steep rise in **kidnappings** and **bodily assaults**, indicating a shift from remote or military-style attacks to more personal, targeted violence. Meanwhile, the use of IEDs and vehicle-based bombs remains present but relatively limited compared to other methods. This transformation suggests changing conflict dynamics — and changing risks for humanitarians.

## 📈 What Happens to the Victims?

Understanding when attacks happen isn’t enough. We also need to ask: **how severe are they?** Are aid workers being wounded more often — or killed? Or taken hostage?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
victim_trends <- df %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(
    Killed = sum(`Total killed`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Wounded = sum(`Total wounded`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Kidnapped = sum(`Total kidnapped`, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = "Outcome", values_to = "Count")

p_victims <- ggplot(victim_trends, aes(x = Year, y = Count, color = Outcome)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Killed" = "#e63946",
    "Wounded" = "#457b9d",
    "Kidnapped" = "#f4a261"
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Victim Outcomes Over Time",
    subtitle = "More attacks lead to more harm — but what kind?",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Victims",
    color = "Outcome"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p_victims)
```

This line chart tells a sobering story. From 2015 onward, there’s a visible **surge in wounded victims**, aligning with years of high attack frequency. Meanwhile, **fatalities steadily climb until 2023**, where a sharp spike may indicate a deadly escalation — or better reporting. **Kidnappings**, though lower in absolute numbers, appear consistent, confirming a persistent threat. These patterns suggest that while injuries are the most frequent outcome, the **deadliness of attacks is rising**, which should influence how agencies train and equip their teams.

## 🧭 Data Meets Decision-Making

By identifying **when** threats escalate — and **how** their nature shifts — aid agencies can:

- **Anticipate** future high-risk years based on conflict cycles
- **Adapt protocols** to evolving attack types
- **Allocate resources** to prepare for the most harmful outcomes

This isn’t just analysis — it’s **a call to protect those who protect others.**
