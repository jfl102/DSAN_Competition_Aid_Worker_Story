Knowing when aid workers are attacked is important — but **location matters even more**. Some regions are consistently hostile. Others erupt unpredictably.

This section explores the **geography of harm** using event-level data. Each point on the map represents a location where humanitarian workers were attacked — and in many cases, killed or kidnapped.

By mapping these events, we expose patterns of instability that traditional headlines often miss.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(leaflet)

# Load data
df <- read_csv("security_incidents.csv")

# Filter for rows with valid coordinates
map_df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Latitude) & !is.na(Longitude)) %>%
  mutate(
    popup_text = paste0(
      "<strong>Country:</strong> ", Country, "<br>",
      "<strong>Year:</strong> ", Year, "<br>",
      "<strong>Attack Type:</strong> ", `Means of attack`, "<br>",
      "<strong>Context:</strong> ", `Attack context`
    )
  )

# Create leaflet map
leaflet(map_df) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    ~Longitude, ~Latitude,
    radius = 4,
    color = "#e63946",
    stroke = FALSE,
    fillOpacity = 0.6,
    popup = ~popup_text
  ) %>%
  setView(lng = 10, lat = 10, zoom = 2)
```

## 🧭 What the Map Reveals

The map confirms what many field workers already know:

- **Sub-Saharan Africa** and **Middle East** are hotspots for attacks
- Clusters appear in **Afghanistan**, **DR Congo**, **Syria**, and **South Sudan**
- Some remote regions (e.g., Mali, Central African Republic) are overrepresented given their size

This geography of risk allows aid agencies to plan **region-specific safety protocols**.

## 📊 Top 10 Countries by Number of Incidents

Which countries pose the greatest risk to aid workers?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

top_countries <- df %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(Incidents = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  top_n(10, Incidents) %>%
  arrange(desc(Incidents))

p_top <- ggplot(top_countries, aes(x = reorder(Country, Incidents), y = Incidents)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#e63946") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Countries with the Most Incidents",
    subtitle = "Where aid workers face the greatest number of attacks",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Number of Incidents"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 20)))

ggplotly(p_top)
```

From Afghanistan to South Sudan to Syria, the top ten list reads like a global warning signal. These countries are not only experiencing conflict — they are places where **humanitarian neutrality is being repeatedly violated**. The presence of so many incidents in these zones suggests a breakdown of trust and safety for aid organizations. For field teams, this means these locations require **enhanced security, localized threat assessments, and continual reevaluation of risk protocols**.

## 📍 Map of Kidnapping Incidents

Some attacks are deadlier or more complex than others. Let’s isolate **kidnapping** to understand where this specific threat is concentrated.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kidnap_map <- df %>%
  filter(`Means of attack` == "Kidnapping", !is.na(Latitude), !is.na(Longitude)) %>%
  mutate(
    popup_text = paste0(
      "<strong>Country:</strong> ", Country, "<br>",
      "<strong>Year:</strong> ", Year, "<br>",
      "<strong>Context:</strong> ", `Attack context`
    )
  )

leaflet(kidnap_map) %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude,
    radius = 5,
    color = "#f4a261",
    stroke = FALSE,
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    popup = ~popup_text
  ) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", colors = "#f4a261", labels = "Kidnapping", title = "Attack Type")
```

When we zoom in on kidnapping, the story shifts. The **geographic clustering** becomes sharper — places like Iraq, Somalia, and parts of the Sahel light up the map. These aren’t just random abductions. They reflect **organized tactics** in regions where law enforcement is weak, and where humanitarian presence may be politically or financially exploited. For teams operating in these areas, **kidnapping prevention must move from policy to practice** — including route monitoring, local negotiation training, and contingency plans for worst-case scenarios.

## 🚨 Not Just Dots on a Map

Each marker represents not just a location — but an **incident of violence**. Visualizing them on a map makes the scale and spread of danger both **tangible** and **unignorable**.

## 👥 What’s Next?

We’ve seen where these attacks happen — but **who exactly is being targeted**, and **how**?

In the next section, we break down:
- Who is most vulnerable — national vs. international workers?
- What kinds of attacks cause the most harm?
- Are there patterns in how aid workers are wounded, killed, or kidnapped?
