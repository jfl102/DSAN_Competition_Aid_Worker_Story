# 🧠 From Data to Decisions

Across time, geography, and human lives, we’ve traced a painful pattern:

- Attacks on aid workers are **increasing**.
- These attacks are **globally widespread**, but cluster in specific high-risk regions.
- The **majority of victims** are **national staff** — often wounded, kidnapped, or killed in the line of duty.

Each visualization gave us insight, but together they reveal a broader truth:

> **Aid workers efforts are becoming more dangerous — and the risk is not equally shared.**

# 🧠 What We Learned

This was never just about data. It was about what the data reveals when you look at it long enough:

- That **violence against aid workers is rising**, not falling.
- That this violence is **unevenly distributed**, hitting the same fragile regions again and again.
- That **national staff** — those who are closest to the mission — are also those who are most often left behind when danger strikes.

Behind every data point is a moment. Behind every spike, a story.

# 🎯 What Should Be Done?

Each chart in this project wasn’t just a visual — it was evidence. Here's what those insights demand from us:

---

### 🛡️ 1. Protect National Staff Who Face the Highest Risks

📊 *From the Victims & Attacks section:*  
The chart shows that **national staff are far more likely to be victims** than international staff — often by a wide margin.

> 🧠 **Therefore**:  
Humanitarian agencies must **prioritize protection, training, and evacuation planning for national staff**, not just international hires.

These workers are on the frontlines — and the analysis proves they carry the heaviest burden.

---

### 🗓️ 2. Prepare for Conflict Spikes in Advance

📊 *From the Temporal Trends section:*  
We identified clear **spikes in violence** during periods of global conflict (e.g., post-2003, 2013, post-2018).

> 🧠 **Therefore**:  
Organizations should use historical data to **anticipate future spikes** — and **pre-position security support and crisis plans** during conflict anniversaries or known volatile periods.

---

### 🗺️ 3. Deploy Region-Specific Security Resources

📊 *From the Geographic Hotspots map:*  
Incidents cluster in fragile states like **Afghanistan, DR Congo, Syria, and South Sudan**.

> 🧠 **Therefore**:  
Aid agencies should **customize safety protocols by region**, with **greater resources** allocated to high-risk countries identified by the data.

This isn’t guesswork — the data shows where the danger is concentrated.

---

### 📣 4. Use Evidence to Advocate for Stronger Protections

📊 *Across all sections:*  
The scale and scope of attacks show a **systemic disregard for humanitarian neutrality**.

> 🧠 **Therefore**:  
Leaders should use this data in global forums to **advocate for enforcement of international humanitarian law**, demand accountability for attacks, and **protect aid workers’ legal rights** under the Geneva Conventions.

---

Together, these aren’t just recommendations —  
They’re **calls to action**, backed by evidence.


# 🌍 Why This Matters

Aid workers step into chaos with nothing but hope and a mission to help.

They do not wear armor.  
They do not carry weapons.  
Their only protection is the belief that **helping others should never make you a target**.

And yet — time after time — that belief is betrayed.

This project used data to show where that betrayal happens.  
Your next job — our next job — is to use those insights to change the ending!

## 🙏 Thank You for Reading

This story was told with the help of thousands of rows of real-world data.  
But behind each row is something more powerful than numbers:  
**Courage. Loss. And the urgent need for change.**

Let’s not just read the data.  
Let’s remember the people behind it.
