# 👥 The People Behind the Patterns

Humanitarian workers go where others can’t — into war zones, disaster areas, and refugee camps.  
But when violence erupts, **who pays the highest price?**

This section confronts the human toll of these attacks.  
Not just where or when they happen — but **who** they hurt, **how** they suffer, and **what it means** for the future of humanitarian work.

## 🧑‍⚕️ National vs. International Staff

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

df <- read_csv("security_incidents.csv")

totals <- df %>%
  summarise(
    Nationals = sum(`Total nationals`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Internationals = sum(`Total internationals`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Worker Type", values_to = "Count")

p1 <- ggplot(totals, aes(x = `Worker Type`, y = Count, fill = `Worker Type`)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Nationals" = "#e63946", "Internationals" = "#a6bddb")) +
  labs(
    title = "Who Is Affected Most?",
    subtitle = "Total number of national vs. international workers affected by attacks",
    y = "Number of Victims",
    x = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p1)

## 👣 The Invisible Majority

The chart speaks volumes: **national staff are overwhelmingly more affected** by security incidents than their international counterparts.

They are the logisticians, translators, and local health workers — often the first on the scene and the last to leave.

> They take the same risks, but don’t always get the same protection, training, or recognition.

This imbalance raises an ethical question:  
**Are we doing enough to protect those who carry the heaviest burden?**

### 💥 **Bar Chart: Nature of Harm**


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
impact <- df %>%
  summarise(
    Killed = sum(`Total killed`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Wounded = sum(`Total wounded`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Kidnapped = sum(`Total kidnapped`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Outcome", values_to = "Count")

p2 <- ggplot(impact, aes(x = Outcome, y = Count, fill = Outcome)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Killed" = "#e63946",
    "Wounded" = "#457b9d",
    "Kidnapped" = "#f4a261"
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Nature of Harm",
    subtitle = "Types of harm aid workers have experienced in attacks",
    y = "Number of People",
    x = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p2)

## 🕯️ From Risk to Reality

Being wounded is the most common outcome — but the number of people **killed** or **kidnapped** is staggering.

These aren’t numbers. These are stories of:
- Drivers ambushed on rural roads
- Nurses caught in crossfire
- Field officers abducted while delivering food

Each one reflects a **breach of humanitarian neutrality** — and a growing disregard for international law.

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Understanding who gets hurt, and how, is more than academic. It’s the foundation for:
- Smarter field protocols
- Targeted safety investments
- Ethical hiring and risk-sharing policies

This data forces us to face a hard truth:  
**Risk is not equally shared — but it can be more fairly managed.**
