# 👥 The People Behind the Patterns

Humanitarian workers go where others can’t — into war zones, disaster areas, and refugee camps.  
But when violence erupts, **who pays the highest price?**

This section follows a scroll-driven path through the human cost of aid work.  
As you move down, let the data guide the story — one chart, one insight at a time.

## 🧑‍⚕️ Nationals Bear the Brunt

> First, let’s look at *who* is being harmed.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

df <- read_csv("security_incidents.csv")

totals <- df %>%
  summarise(
    Nationals = sum(`Total nationals`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Internationals = sum(`Total internationals`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Worker Type", values_to = "Count")

p1 <- ggplot(totals, aes(x = `Worker Type`, y = Count, fill = `Worker Type`)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Nationals" = "#e63946", "Internationals" = "#a6bddb")) +
  labs(
    title = "Who Is Affected Most?",
    subtitle = "Total number of national vs. international workers affected by attacks",
    y = "Number of Victims",
    x = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p1)
```

**National staff** — not international expats — suffer the vast majority of attacks.  
They’re the ones who stay after the cameras leave.

> This raises a critical question:  
Are we doing enough to protect those closest to the danger?

## 🩸 What Kind of Harm?

> Next: What happens to those who are targeted?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
impact <- df %>%
  summarise(
    Killed = sum(`Total killed`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Wounded = sum(`Total wounded`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Kidnapped = sum(`Total kidnapped`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Outcome", values_to = "Count")

p2 <- ggplot(impact, aes(x = Outcome, y = Count, fill = Outcome)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Killed" = "#e63946",
    "Wounded" = "#457b9d",
    "Kidnapped" = "#f4a261"
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Nature of Harm",
    subtitle = "Types of harm aid workers have experienced in attacks",
    y = "Number of People",
    x = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(p2)
```

Most are **wounded**, but thousands have been **killed or kidnapped**.  
These are not isolated cases — they’re systemic outcomes of conflict and disregard.

## 🔥 Do Some Attacks Hurt More?

> Not all attacks lead to the same outcomes. Some are deadlier than others.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
attack_summary <- df %>%
  group_by(`Means of attack`) %>%
  summarise(
    Killed = sum(`Total killed`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Wounded = sum(`Total wounded`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Kidnapped = sum(`Total kidnapped`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Means of attack`)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Killed, Wounded, Kidnapped), names_to = "Outcome", values_to = "Count")

p3 <- ggplot(attack_summary, aes(x = reorder(`Means of attack`, -Count), y = Count, fill = Outcome)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Killed" = "#e63946",
    "Wounded" = "#457b9d",
    "Kidnapped" = "#f4a261"
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Impact of Different Attack Types",
    subtitle = "Comparing number of victims by attack method and outcome type",
    x = "Means of Attack",
    y = "Number of Victims",
    fill = "Outcome"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))

ggplotly(p3)
```

This chart shows the harsh truth:

- **Shootings** are the most lethal.
- **Kidnappings** cause fewer deaths, but more psychological trauma.
- **Aerial attacks and IEDs** often wound in high numbers — especially in urban areas.

> Aid agencies can use this data to match their response protocols to real-world risk.

## 🎯 What It All Means

We now know:

- **Who** gets hurt: Mostly national staff
- **How** they’re harmed: Killed, kidnapped, and wounded in large numbers
- **By what**: A range of violent tactics, some more deadly than others

This isn't just tragedy. It's **a call to act wisely and plan better**.
