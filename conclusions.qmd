# 🧠 From Data to Decisions

Across time, geography, and human lives, we’ve traced a painful pattern:

- Attacks on aid workers are **increasing**.
- These attacks are **globally widespread**, but cluster in specific high-risk regions.
- The **majority of victims** are **national staff** — often wounded, kidnapped, or killed in the line of duty.

Each visualization gave us insight, but together they reveal a broader truth:

> **Aid workers efforts are becoming more dangerous — and the risk is not equally shared.**

# 🧠 What We Learned

This was never just about data. It was about what the data reveals when you look at it long enough:

- That **violence against aid workers is rising**, not falling.
- That this violence is **unevenly distributed**, hitting the same fragile regions again and again.
- That **national staff** — those who are closest to the mission — are also those who are most often left behind when danger strikes.

Behind every data point is a moment. Behind every spike, a story.

# 🎯 What Should Be Done?

This isn’t where the story ends. This is the part where we take what we’ve seen — and decide what to do next.

### 🛡️ Protect Local Staff, Not Just International Ones

They take the same risks. They deserve the same security, training, and escape routes.

### 📊 Use History to Prepare for the Future

We now know that violence follows patterns — conflict flare-ups, election years, regional instability.  
**Let’s not wait to be surprised.**

### 📢 Demand Respect for Humanitarian Law

The increasing normalization of attacks on aid workers must not be met with silence.  
The data speaks — but it’s up to us to make sure someone listens.

# 🌍 Why This Matters

Aid workers step into chaos with nothing but hope and a mission to help.

They do not wear armor.  
They do not carry weapons.  
Their only protection is the belief that **helping others should never make you a target**.

And yet — time after time — that belief is betrayed.

This project used data to show where that betrayal happens.  
Your next job — our next job — is to use those insights to change the ending.

## 🙏 Thank You for Reading

This story was told with the help of thousands of rows of real-world data.  
But behind each row is something more powerful than numbers:  
**Courage. Loss. And the urgent need for change.**

Let’s not just read the data.  
Let’s remember the people behind it.
