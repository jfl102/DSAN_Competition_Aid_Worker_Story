> *“Helping others should never make you a target.”*

And yet — from dusty roads in South Sudan to hospitals in Gaza, **aid workers are being shot at, kidnapped, and killed**.

This project is not just about data.  
It’s about the people behind the data.

## 🔍 What’s the Story?

Since 1997, thousands of violent incidents targeting humanitarian staff have been recorded. The risk has grown, the world has changed — and **the people delivering life-saving aid are now often caught in the crossfire**.

In this project, we ask:

- 🕰️ **When** did this rise in violence begin?
- 🌍 **Where** are these attacks happening?
- 👥 **Who** is being harmed — and how?
- 🎯 **What** can be done to protect them?

## 📌 Why It Matters

The mission of humanitarian work is simple: to help.

But the mission can’t be fulfilled if the helpers are unsafe.  
This story — told with real-world data and powerful visuals — aims to **reframe the conversation**, inform smarter decisions, and **protect those who protect others**.
