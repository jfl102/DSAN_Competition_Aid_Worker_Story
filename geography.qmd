title: "🌍 Mapping the Danger"

Knowing when aid workers are attacked is important — but **location matters even more**. Some regions are consistently hostile. Others erupt unpredictably.

This section explores the **geography of harm** using event-level data. Each point on the map represents a location where humanitarian workers were attacked — and in many cases, killed or kidnapped.

By mapping these events, we expose patterns of instability that traditional headlines often miss.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(leaflet)

# Load data
df <- read_csv("security_incidents.csv")

# Filter for rows with valid coordinates
map_df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Latitude) & !is.na(Longitude)) %>%
  mutate(
    popup_text = paste0(
      "<strong>Country:</strong> ", Country, "<br>",
      "<strong>Year:</strong> ", Year, "<br>",
      "<strong>Attack Type:</strong> ", `Means of attack`, "<br>",
      "<strong>Context:</strong> ", `Attack context`
    )
  )

# Create leaflet map
leaflet(map_df) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    ~Longitude, ~Latitude,
    radius = 4,
    color = "#e63946",
    stroke = FALSE,
    fillOpacity = 0.6,
    popup = ~popup_text
  ) %>%
  setView(lng = 10, lat = 10, zoom = 2)
```

## 🧭 What the Map Reveals

The map confirms what many field workers already know:

- **Sub-Saharan Africa** and **Middle East** are hotspots for attacks
- Clusters appear in **Afghanistan**, **DR Congo**, **Syria**, and **South Sudan**
- Some remote regions (e.g., Mali, Central African Republic) are overrepresented given their size

This geography of risk allows aid agencies to plan **region-specific safety protocols**.

## 🚨 Not Just Dots on a Map

Each marker represents not just a location — but an **incident of violence**. Visualizing them on a map makes the scale and spread of danger both **tangible** and **unignorable**.

## 👥 What’s Next?

We’ve seen where these attacks happen — but **who exactly is being targeted**, and **how**?

In the next section, we break down:
- Who is most vulnerable — national vs. international workers?
- What kinds of attacks cause the most harm?
- Are there patterns in how aid workers are wounded, killed, or kidnapped?
